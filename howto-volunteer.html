<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
On behalf of the GNU Project Volunteer Coordinators, <em>thank you</em>
for your interest in helping GNU!
The GNU Volunteer Coordinators' job is to help advance the cause of
Free Software by helping GNU volunteers. We want you to find an
interesting, challenging and fun way to contribute because then
you'll be more likely to make a long-term commitment to GNU.
Getting started can be difficult so we wrote this document to help
you determine the best way for you to help GNU.
</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>
The GNU Project (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a>) writes,
distributes, and promotes free software. The "free" in free software
refers to liberty, not price: the freedom to use, modify, share, and
improve the software. Free Software has many practical advantages
over proprietary software but those are secondary benefits: GNU's
rationale is <a http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/>ethical</a>, not practical.
Free Software is <em>better</em> than proprietary
software for the same reasons that freedom is <em>better</em> than tyranny.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>
launched the GNU Project in
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html">1983</a>
to develop a complete Unix-like
operating system that is free software: the GNU system. (GNU is a
recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"; it is pronounced "guh-NEW".)
In the years since the project began it has built, maintained and
distributed some of the most important programs in use today: the GNU
Compiler Collection (known as GCC), the GNU Debugger (known as GDB),
the GNU C library, and the EMACS editor, among others. Along the way
the project's scope grew and now GNU is much more than just a
computer operating system: you can use GNU software to make telephone
calls, design electronic circuits, write music, play chess, and many
other things. There is currently no GNU software that can make
toast, but that will likely change someday.
</p>
<p>
The GNU Project is loosely organized, more like a republic than
a monarchy. <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>
is the project leader. Projects can choose to
become GNU projects if they share the core GNU values, agree to
follow the GNU standards, and fit into the GNU system. You can help
GNU in many ways, but as a rule of thumb if you're helping the cause
of Free Software then you're helping GNU.
</p>

<h3 id="learnabout">Learn About GNU</h3>
<p>
As we discussed in the introduction, the GNU project's
motivation is ethical rather than practical.  We believe that Free
Software benefits society by preserving the freedoms of those who use it.
Many people aren't as concerned about
these issues and worry more about what's expedient for them.  Often
those people get frustrated when we hold to our principles rather
than compromising them.  That's why it's important that you take the
time to learn about our beliefs (see our
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">philosophy page</a>) and
decide which of them you agree with.  We're confident that once you
learn about the solid ethical foundation that the GNU project rests
on you'll want to help.
</p>

<h3 id="decide">Decide What To Do</h3>
<p>
If you've learned about GNU and Free Software and would like to
help us then the next question is: what would you like to do?  You
can help GNU in many ways; we need
people to write documents such as books, reference guides and online
info, we also need people to write software, do research, and many other
tasks.  Because of all of the different tasks at hand, we are sure
that you have skills that can help the GNU Project; you
don't have to be an experienced software developer to help us.
</p>
<p>
What skills and experience do you have?<br>
Do you have experience writing technical documents?<br>
Do you speak more than one human language?<br>
Do you have programming skills?<br>
Do you have software to contribute under GNU General Public License?<br>
Do you have any other skill which you deem useful for GNU?<br>
Would you like to help free software by doing
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/help/">work</a>
not requiring specialists but still getting too little attention?<br>
</p>
<p>
Obviously, the answers to these questions will determine the sorts
of tasks that you'll want to work on.
Before investing time in details, consider what you have, what you
want to give, and how this fits into GNU. Then come and help us.
</p>
<p>
There are many ways to help GNU.  As Fred Brooks pointed out,
there's much more to building successful software products than
simply writing a computer program.  Products need testing,
documentation, and translations.  Even the projects that build the
products can use help, for example maintaining web pages or triaging
bug reports.  Here are a few common skill areas that are helpful, and
resources to find out more about them:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Write code.  For more information on coding for GNU please read the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding Standards</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Write Documentation.  First, it's important that the GNU project
be consistent.  We can't have 40 different documentation formats
floating around, therefore GNU documentation is written in a
language called <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual">
Texinfo</a>.
Second, writing good
documentation is a time-consuming exercise so we ask that people
consider whether they're able to commit at least a few hours per
week before getting involved in a large project (such as writing a
new manual).  If you find yourself unable to make such a commitment
then we'd still appreciate your help in areas such as proofreading,
though.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Translate.
There's a lot of translation to be done, and we'd appreciate your
help.  Please understand that it's more helpful to write new
documentation than translate existing docs, but again we would
appreciate any help that you can offer.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Your time is about the most precious donation to GNU. Any amount is
useful. Don't feel pressured to commit yourself to more than you can
afford without losing the fun in doing your volunteer work.
If you recognize to have bitten off too much, then reconsider your
goal, possibly scale it down to become more feasible, and remember
that endurance can overcome many obstacles.
<br>
In general we advise you to start with small changes in order to become
familiar with the project and its developers.
</p>
<p>
How can you help given the amount of time that you'd like to
donate?  There are many roles to play within a project; naturally,
some consume more time than others.  In order of increasing
commitment:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
User.  An easy and fun way to help GNU and Free Software
is to use Free Software for all of your computer tasks.  By doing so,
you're joining a community of people who are living their beliefs.
Users can help in many important ways such as writing high-quality
bug reports, making feature requests, and gathering functional
requirements.  Users provide important feedback to the maintainers.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Contributor.  Many people want to help projects with code,
documentation, packaging, et cetera but aren't ready to make the
commitment (or don't have the experience) to be maintainers.
Contributors make non-trivial commitments to the project but usually
at a lower intensity than maintainers.  Contributors can report bugs
but will often fix the ones that they find, or at least investigate
their causes.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Maintainer.  Maintainers are the project leaders; they
commit substantial time, energy, and emotion to their projects.
Typically, a maintainer will be the ultimate arbiter of any design or
coding issues that arise within the project.  It's a prestigious
title, but requires effort to earn and a substantial investment to
keep.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="find">Find Something To Work On</h3>
<p>
Now that you've thought about how much time you'd like to
contribute, and which roles might be right for you, it's time to find
something to do!
If you want to convert an existing software project to a GNU project,
contact gvc@gnu.org. Else it's best to work on something that you use
yourself, something that makes your life easier.
<br>
For example, if you want to improve documentation, get the original
document and try to become familiar enough with its format to be able
to make changes. If it stays riddling, summarize your change plan for
the developers of the project and ask them for advise about the format.
<br>
Or, if you want to improve GNU software by fixing bugs or adding features,
then download the source code, fire up your favorite editor
and start learning how the program is put together.
Again, if riddles remain then summarize your plan and ask the developers.
</p>
<p>
To contact them subscribe to the development mailing list for that
project and write a friendly, not too long mail to that list. Expect
to be asked about details or background. Please do not take this as
rejection or nitpicking.
<br>
The project developers will
probably have a list of tasks to work on.  If you've thought of
something yourself it's a good idea to check with the developers
before spending too much time on it; someone else might already be
working on the same thing and you don't want to waste your
effort.
</p>
<p>
If no project jumps out at you then you'll probably want to
search for a project that needs help.  Here are some places to
look:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>

</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Ask the GVC for help by sending email to <a href="mailto:gvc@gnu.org">
gvc@gnu.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
It will be important that the authorship of your contributions is
properly documented. Your statements will be taken seriously and
not be doubted unless evidence of the contrary is shown.
<br>
If your contribution is
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Legally-Significant">
legally significant</a>
and you are the copyright holder, then you will need to agree to the
project's license. If your contribution contains
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Copying-from-Other-Packages">
work with copyright by others</a>, then you need to present a sufficient
license statement by the copyright holders.
</p>

<h3 id="getinvolved">Get Involved</h3>
<p>
Once you've found a project, how do you get involved?  The best
approach is to familiarize yourself with the project's work to date
and then approach the project development team and offer your help.
Download the software, build it and spend some time learning how it
works and how the source code is structured.  If you have questions
you can ask the developers (preferably via the development mailing
lists) but please be respectful of their time.
</p>
<p>
Many projects communicate using mailing lists, so you'll want to
find the project's developer mailing list and subscribe to it.
Different projects have different cultures so it's prudent to "lurk"
on the list for a few days to learn the developers' style before
diving in.  When you're ready, send a message offering your help.  If
you have an idea to improve the program, you might want to check with
the developers to see if anyone else is working on something similar
- if so you'll want to coordinate your efforts so you don't waste
time.  If you don't have a specific idea but want to help the
project, say so and someone will suggest something to work on.
</p>
