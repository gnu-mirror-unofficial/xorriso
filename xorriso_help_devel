Options with variable length path list [...] need the list delimiter text
as end mark if they are followed by another option. By default this delimiter
is "--". In dialog and with options read from files, the line end serves
as such a mark. With program arguments this mark can be omitted only with
the last option in the list of arguments.
For brevity the list delimiter is referred as "--" throughout this text.

  -list_delimiter text   Set the list delimiter to be used instead of "--"
                 It has to be a single word, must not be empty, not longer

  -show_stream iso_rr_path [***]
                 Show content stream chain of data files in the ISO image.
  -show_stream_r iso_rr_path [***]
                 Like -show_stream but affecting all files below directories.

Restore options which copy file objects from ISO image to disk filesystem:
  -osirrox "on"|"device_files"|"off"|"banned"
           [:"concat_split_on"|"concat_split_off"]
           [:"auto_chmod_on"|"auto_chmod_off"]
           [:"sort_lba_on"|"sort_lba_off"]
                 By default "off" the inverse operation of xorriso from ISO
                 image to disk filesystem is disabled. "on" allows xorriso
                 to create, overwrite, delete files in the disk filesystem.
                 "banned" is irrevocably "off".
  -extract iso_rr_path disk_path
                 Copy tree under iso_rr_path onto disk address disk_path.
                 This avoids the pitfalls of cp -r addressing rules.
  -extract_l iso_rr_prefix disk_prefix iso_rr_path [***]
                 Perform -extract with each iso_rr_path.
  -extract_single iso_rr_path disk_path
                 Like -extract but with directory do not restore sub tree.
  -extract_cut iso_rr_path byte_offset byte_count disk_path
                 Copy a byte interval from iso_rr_path to disk_path.
                 This is governed in part by -check_media_defaults.
  -cpx iso_rr_path [***] disk_path
                 Copy leaf file objects from ISO image to disk filesystem.
  -cpax iso_rr_path [***] disk_path
                 Like -cpx but trying to restore timestamps and ownership.
  -cp_rx iso_rr_path [***] disk_path
                 Copy directory trees from ISO image to disk filesystem.
  -cp_rax iso_rr_path [***] disk_path
                 Like -cp_rx but trying to restore timestamps and ownership.
  -paste_in iso_rr_path disk_path byte_offset byte_count
                 Copy ISO file content into a byte interval of a disk file.
  -mount drive entity id path
                 Like -mount_cmd but actually performing that command if
                 not setuid or setgid is active.

Evaluation of readability:
  -check_media [options] --
                 Try to read data blocks from media and report about the
                 outcome. Several options modify the behavior:
                  use=indev|outdev , what=track|session ,
                  min_lba=blockadr , max_lba=blockadr ,
                  abort_file=path , time_limit=seconds , item_limit=number ,
                  retry=on|off|default , data_to=filepath ,
                  sector_map=filepath , map_with_volid=on|off ,
                  patch_lba0=on|off|force|blockadr[:force] ,
                  report=blocks|files|blocks_files event=severity ,
                  bad_limit=quality , slow_limit=seconds , chunk_size=bytes
  -check_media_defaults [options] --
                 Preset options for runs of -check_media and -extract_cut.

Compatibility emulation (argument list may be ended by list delimiter --):
  -as mkisofs  [-help|-version|-o|-R|-J|-V|-P|-f|-m|-exclude-list|-no-pad|
                -M|-C|-graft-points|-path-list|pathspecs|-z|
                -no-emul-boot|-b|-c|-boot-info-table|-boot-load-size]
              Perform some mkisofs gestures, understand pathspecs as mkisofs
              does. Commit happens outside emulation at usual occasions.
  -as cdrecord [-help|-v|dev=|speed=|blank=|fs=|-eject|-atip|padsize=|-multi]
               path|-
              Perform some cdrecord gestures, eventually write at most one
              data track to blank, appendable or overwriteable media.
  -pacifier "xorriso"|"cdrecord"|"mkisofs"
              Choose format of UPDATE pacifier during write operations.

General options:
  -help       Print this text
  -abort_on severity   Set the threshhold for events to abort the program.
              Useful severities: NEVER, ABORT, FATAL, FAILURE, SORRY, WARNING
  -return_with severity exit_value   Set the threshhold for events to return
              at program end the given exit_value even if not aborted.
              exit_value may be 0 or 32 to 63.
  -report_about severity   Set the threshhold for events to be reported.
              Use -abort_on severities or: HINT, NOTE, UPDATE, DEBUG, ALL
  -error_behavior "image_loading"|"file_extraction" behavior
              Behavior "best_effort" is most endurant but may produce
              results which are correct only on the first glimpse.
  -dialog "on"|"off"|"single_line"
              After all arguments are processed, enter dialog mode.
              "single_line" does not support newline characters within
              open quotation marks and no line continuation by trailing \.
  -page len width  Prompt user after len output lines (0=no prompt).
              width (default 80) can adjust line number computation
              to the output terminal's line width.
  -use_stdin  Use raw standard input even if libreadline is available
  -use_readline  Use libreadline for dialog if available
  -history text  Copy text into libreadline history. This command
              itself is not copied to the history list.
  -backslash_codes "on"|"off"|
                   "in_double_quotes"|"in_quotes"|"with_quoted_input"
                   [:"with_program_arguments"][:"encode_output"]
              Disable or enable interpretation of \a \b \e \f \n \r \t \v
              \\ \NNN \xNN \cC in input or program arguments.
  -pkt_output "on"|"off"  Direct output to stdout and prefix each line
              by a short header which tells channel id and a mode number.
              Each such output packet is finalized by a newline.
              Channel ids are 'R:' for result lines, 'I:' for notes
              and error messages, 'M:' for -mark texts. Bit 0 of the
              mode number tells whether the newline is also part of the
              packet payload. Example of a info message with newline:
                I:1: enter option text :
              -pkt_output:on is intended for use by frontend programs.
  -logfile channel fileaddress  Copy output of a channel to the given file.
              channel may be 'R','I','M' as with -pkt_output or '.'
              for the consolidated -pkt_output stream.
  -mark text  If text is not empty it will get put out each time an
              option is completed.
  -temp_mem_limit number["k"|"m"]
              Set the maximum size for pattern expansion. (Default is 16m)
  -prog text  Use text as this program's name in subsequent messages
  -prog_help text  Use text as this program's name and perform -help
  -status mode|filter  Report the current settings of persistent options.
              Modes:
                 short... print only important or altered options
                 long ... print options even if they have default settings
                 long_history  like long plus -history: lines
              Filters begin with '-' and are compared literally against the
              output lines of -status long_history. A line is put out only
              if its start matches the filter.
  -status_history_max number  Maximum number of history lines to be reported
              with -status:long_history
  -options_from_file fileaddress
              Reads lines from the given file and executes them as program
              options.
  -no_rc      Only if used as first command line argument this option
              prevents reading and interpretation of startup files.
  -print text
              Print a text to result channel.
  -prompt text
              Wait for Enter key resp. for a line of input at stdin.
  -errfile_log mode path|channel
              Log disk paths of files involved in problem events.
  -session_log path
              Set path of a file where a log record gets appended after
              each session. Form: timestamp start_lba size volume-id
  -scsi_log "on"|"off"
              Enable or disable logging of SCSI commands to stderr.
  # any text  Is ignored. In dialog mode the input line will be stored in
              the eventual readline history, nevertheless.
  -version    Tell program and version number
  -end        End program. Commit eventual pending changes.
  -rollback_end
              End program. Discard pending changes.


Option -page causes a user prompt after the given number of result lines.
Empty input resumes output until the next prompt. Other input may be:
  @     suppresses paging until the current action is done
  @@    suppresses further result output but continues the action
  @@@   aborts the current action
  other aborts the current action and executes input as new
        option
