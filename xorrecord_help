GNU xorriso 1.4.4 : RockRidge filesystem manipulator, libburnia project.

Usage: xorriso -as cdrecord [options|source_addresses]
Note: This is not cdrecord. See xorriso -help, xorriso -version, man xorrecord
Options:
	-version	print version information and exit emulation
	--devices	print list of available MMC drives and exit emulation
	dev=target	pseudo-SCSI target to use as CD-Recorder
	drive_scsi_dev_family=sr|scd|sg		select Linux device type
	-v		increment verbose level by one
	-V		increment SCSI command transport verbose level by one
	-checkdrive	check if a driver for the drive is present
	-inq		do an inquiry for the drive
	speed=#		set speed of drive
	blank=type	blank a CD-RW disc (see blank=help)
	fs=#		Set fifo size to # (0 to disable, default is 4 MB)
	-eject		eject the disk after doing the work
	-dummy		do everything with laser turned off
	-msinfo		retrieve multi-session info for mkisofs >= 1.10
	-toc		retrieve and print TOC/PMA data
	-atip		retrieve media state, print "Is *erasable"
	-multi		generate a TOC that allows multi session
	--multi_if_possible	apply -multi if the medium supports it
	-waiti		wait until input is available before opening SCSI
	-tao		Write disk in TAO mode.
	-dao		Write disk in SAO mode.
	-sao		Write disk in SAO mode.
	tsize=#		announces exact size of source data
	padsize=#	Amount of padding
	-data		Subsequent tracks are CD-ROM data mode 1 (default)
	-isosize	Use iso9660 file system size for next data track
	-pad		padsize=30k
	-nopad		Do not pad
	minbuf=		Keep drive buffer hungry
	modesty_on_drive=	Like minbuf=, but with more parameters
	-immed		Equivalent to minbuf=75
	--grow_overwriteable_iso	emulate multi-session on DVD+RW, BD-RE
	write_start_address=#		write to byte address on DVD+RW, BD-RE
	stream_recording=on|number	try to get full speed on DVD-RAM, BD
	dvd_obs=default|32k|64k		bytes per DVD/BD write operation
	stdio_sync=on|off|end|number	whether to fsync output to "stdio:"
	--no_rc		Do not execute xorriso startup files
	-help		print this text to stderr and exit emulation
Actually this is the integrated ISO RockRidge filesystem manipulator xorriso
lending its libburn capabilities to a very limited cdrecord emulation. Only
a single data track can be burnt to blank, appendable or overwriteable media.
A much more elaborate cdrecord emulator is cdrskin from the same project.
